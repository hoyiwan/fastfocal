\title{Generate weight matrix for focal operations using map units}
\usage{
fastfocal_weights(x, d, w = "circle", normalize = TRUE, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SpatRaster (for resolution).}

\item{d}{numeric. Radius in map units.}

\item{w}{character. "rectangle","circle","circular","gaussian","Gauss",
"pareto","idw","exponential","triangular","cosine","logistic","cauchy",
"quartic","epanechnikov".}

\item{normalize}{logical. Normalize weights to sum to 1 (default TRUE).}

\item{plot}{logical. If TRUE, plots the kernel.}
}
\value{
numeric matrix of weights.
}
\description{
Builds an UNnormalized kernel from map units. Circle uses a center-distance
rule (include a cell if its center is within radius \code{d}); other kernels follow
the same definitions as before. For exact equality with terra's discrete
circle, pass \code{w = terra::focalMat(x, d, type = "circle")} into \code{fastfocal()}.
