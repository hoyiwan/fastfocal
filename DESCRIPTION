Description: Provides fast moving-window ("focal") and buffer-based extraction 
    for raster data using the 'terra' package. Automatically selects between 
    a 'C++' backend (via 'terra') and a Fast Fourier Transform ('FFT') backend 
    depending on problem size. The 'FFT' backend supports sum and mean, while 
    other statistics (e.g., median, min, max, standard deviation) are handled 
    by the 'terra' backend. Supports multiple kernel types (e.g., circle, 
    rectangle, gaussian), with 'NA' handling consistent with 'terra' via 
    'na.rm' and 'na.policy'. Operates on 'SpatRaster' objects and returns 
    results with the same geometry.
